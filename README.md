## Project Overview

This project is aimed at demonstrating the ability to tackle real-world problems using modern software development practices. Async-race is an application, which takes the random data for different cars and they are competing with one another. Application contains two folders. **async-race-api**, which is forked from the repository by [Mikhama](https://github.com/mikhama/async-race-api). It contains all of the server-side information, including database for cars, winners and cars engine charachteristics (such as velocity of the car and race distance). The second folder is **async-race-react-app**. It contains the front-end part of the application, including UI/UX and code for its embodiment. Application connects to the provided server and allows to manage operations with it, creating a fully working application, which is powered by React framework and TypeScript superset of JavaScript language.

- **Garage** view:
    In the garage view all the information about cars is displayed. It takes data from testing server and shows the list of the cars available at the moment. Pagination is applied to the list of data and displays 7 records per page. For navigating through other pages, user may use <ins><</ins>(previous page) and <ins>></ins>(next page) buttons. Available buttons in the garage view and their actions:
    - <ins>'Generate cars'</ins> button allows to create *100 absolutely random cars* with random names and color. Further user can interact with them and they are also participating in the race. 
    - <ins>'Create'</ins> button takes the information from the form inputs correlated with it (name and color). For creation the car user MUST input its *name*, while *color* input is OPTIONAL. If *color* is not specified, by default the car will be of the *black* color.
    - <ins>'Update'</ins> button takes the information from the form inputs correlated with it (name and color). For updating the car, user must SELECT the car, which them want to update. It is available to change *only* name of the car or *only* color.
    - <ins>'Select'</ins> button applies to every car in the garage. It allows to *select* one particular car *for changing* either its name or color, depending on user's wish. However, the user must be aware that ONLY ONE car is available for editing at a time. If them has already selected the car, first of all it needs to be deselected, before making changes to another car.
    - <ins>'Remove'</ins> button applies to every car in the garage. It allows to remove the car from the race.
    - <ins>'A'</ins> button applies to every car in the garage. It takes the car engine data and *starts this one car*. After the car had reached its finish, there is a window, which displays the time in which the car had reached the finish.
    - <ins>'B'</ins> button applies to every car in the garage. After the car had started its movement, it *allows to stop the car* in the middle of the race.
    - <ins>'Race'</ins> button makes all the cars move and start the race between them. The car, which reached the finsih first will be announced and added to winners list.
    - <ins>'Reset'</ins> button resets the started race and makes cars move back to the start.

- **Winner** view:
    On the winners page the user may see the data about all of the race winners (excluding singular car races). Pagination is applied to the list of data and displays 7 records per page. For navigating through other pages, user may use <ins><</ins>(previous page) and <ins>></ins>(next page) buttons. The data in the winners list is *sorted by the best time records* (the greatest time = the highest position on the list).

## Getting started
These instructions will help to get you a copy of the project up and running it on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites:
(ATTENTION!) To run this project you need to have **Node JS** installed. If it is not installed, follow the instructions on their [website](https://nodejs.org/en) on downloading and installing it to your machine. 

### Steps
1. Clone the repository with local server information from https://github.com/mikhama/async-race-api
   `$ git clone  https://github.com/mikhama/async-race-api.git`
2. Clone current repository with the project to your local machine.
   `$ git clone https://github.com/Kimi-Toshiko/EPAM-Internship-test-task.git`
3. Open through command line(terminal) each of the folder (both **async-race-api** and **async-race-react-app**)
   `$ cd /your path to directories/`[^1]
   [^1]: Be aware, that depending on the type of the terminal, you may either enter the full path to the folder or access it only step by step(command going to each directory one by one). As a recommendation, you may use **Git Bash** terminal, which allows to insert the full path to the directory.
4. Inside each of the folders (both **async-race-api** and **async-race-react-app**) run the following command:
   `$ npm install`
   It will automatically download all needed dependencies for the project.
   *(IMPORTANT) Without this step neither the program nor JSON server will not be working properly. This is an important step.*
5. Start the test JSON server. Go to **async-race-api** directory through the terminal. Run the following command in the terminal to start JSON server:
    `$ npm start`
    By default the server will start running on your machine local port 3000.
    `http://localhost:3000/`
6. Start the application. I recommend to use the production build through the following link: `https://epam-internship-test-task.vercel.app/` as there is no double data accessing.[^2]
   [^2]: However, you may use the development build through the following guide:
Go to **async-race-react-app** directory through the terminal.Run the following command in the terminal to start Async-Race application:
   `$npm start`
   By default the server will start running on your machine local port 8000.
   `http://localhost:8000/`
